Workflow description in CWL
------------------------------------
A workflow is a set of jobs with certain relationships.
Using Common Workflow Language (CWL), one can describe various types of workflow.
In `this page <https://panda-wms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/client/pchain.html#workflow-examples>`_ listed a lot of such examples and the cwl descriptive code is given.
In the application of active learning, we will use the particular example of *Loops in workflows*.
Its DAG (directed acyclic graph) scheme is shown in the figure below.
